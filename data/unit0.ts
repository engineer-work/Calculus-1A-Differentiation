### David Jerison
David Jerison received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1980, and joined the mathematics faculty at MIT in 1981. In 1985, he received an A.P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship and a Presidential Young Investigator Award. In 1999 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2004, he was selected for a Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellowship in recognition of his teaching. In 2012, the American Mathematical Society awarded him and his collaborator Jack Lee the Bergman Prize in Complex Analysis.

Professor Jerison's research focuses on PDEs and Fourier Analysis. He has taught single variable calculus, multivariable calculus, and differential equations at MIT several times each.

### Gigliola Staffilani
Gigliola Staffilani is the Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor of Mathematics since 2007. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1995. Following faculty appointments at Stanford, Princeton, and Brown, she joined the MIT mathematics faculty in 2002. She received both a teaching award and a research fellowship while at Stanford. She received a Sloan Foundation Fellowship in 2000. In 2014 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Professor Staffilani is an analyst, with a concentration on dispersive nonlinear PDEs. She has taught multivariable calculus several times at MIT, as well as differential equations.

## Instructors

### Jen French
Jen French is an MITx Digital Learning Scientist in the MIT math department. She earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT in 2010, with specialization in Algebraic Topology. After teaching after school math for elementary aged students and working with the Teaching and Learning Lab at MIT developing interdisciplinary curricular videos tying foundational concepts in math and science to engineering design themes, she joined MITx in 2013. She has developed videos, visual interactives, and problems providing immediate feedback using the edX platform residentially in the MIT math department to aid student learning. She has developed the calculus series (3 courses) and differential equations series (5 courses) available here on edX.

### Stephen Wang
Stephen Wang earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 2006, where he specialized in geometry. He has earned teaching awards from both Chicago and Harvard University, and has also been a faculty member at Haverford College and Bucknell University before jumping on board the calculus team at MIT. In fall 2015 he joined the Rice University mathematics faculty.

## Special thanks to

Huge thanks to Prof. Arthur Mattuck for starting it all. Big thanks to Timothy Hall for asking David Jerison the question, how do ziplines behave mathematically. We also thank David Custer and Susan Ruff who helped with real life ziplines and shared MIT student experiments on ziplines.

    content: `### Course Description

Discover the derivative—what it is, how to compute it, and when to apply it in solving real world problems. Part 1 of 3.

How does the final velocity on a zip line change when the starting point is raised or lowered by a matter of centimeters? What is the accuracy of a GPS position measurement? How fast should an airplane travel to minimize fuel consumption? The answers to all of these questions involve the derivative.

But what is the derivative? You will learn its mathematical notation, physical meaning, geometric interpretation, and be able to move fluently between these representations of the derivative. You will discover how to differentiate any function you can think up, and develop a powerful intuition to be able to sketch the graph of many functions. You will make linear and quadratic approximations of functions to simplify computations and gain intuition for system behavior. You will learn to maximize and minimize functions to optimize properties like cost, efficiency, energy, and power.

This course, in combination with 18.01.2x Calculus 1B: Integration, covers the AP Calculus AB curriculum. This course, in combination with 18.01.2x Calculus 1B: Integration and 18.01.3x Calculus 1C: Coordinate Systems and Infinite Series, covers the AP Calculus BC curriculum. If you intend to take an AP exam, we strongly suggest that you familiarize yourself with the AP exam to prepare for it.`

    content: `### The making of this course

This course was created using latex2edX, a free tool developed at MIT for creating content for edX written in LaTeX. LaTeX is a typesetting language that is fantastic for writing math! Occasionally, the equations you see in the webpage (which are rendered in mathjax) do not load appropriately. Our apologies. The easiest fix is to simply reload the page. Another solution is to change browsers. (Firefox seems to render mathjax less reliably than Chrome or Safari. However, frequent changes to edX will cause disruptions in our content.)

Note edX is not supported on tablet devices. That said, users report that 95% of the problems can be done on a tablet device, but if weird errors are creeping in (especially with formula input type problems) you may try switching to a laptop or desktop computer.`

    content: `### How to Succeed

#### Prerequisites

This course has a global audience with students from a wide variety of backgrounds. To succeed in this course, you must have a solid foundation in

* algebra,
* geometry,
* trigonometry,
* exponents,
* logarithms, and
* limits 

We know that many students may not have solid foundation in limits, so we have included an optional Unit 0 that introduces Limits. Understanding limits is essential to understand the first lecture on the definition of the derivative in Unit 1, some Homework problems on Continuity and Differentiability in Unit 1, and the first lecture on Limiting behavior and sketching functions in Unit 4.

Because we know you come from different backgrounds, we want to help you to choose the best path through this content. To aid us in this, please take the “Choose your calculus adventure" diagnostics. This will help you to determine if you have the skills to succeed, what skills you may need to review, and which units you may be able to skip!

#### Reference materials

The material we provide in the Courseware contains all of the content you need for this course. However, there are many good calculus texts that have a great deal of problems and alternate explanations that may help you. Most widely used calculus texts are adequate.

There is also the free web resource [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).

Links to other web resources can be found on the Course Info page under the header “Related Links". Feel free to share other resources on the course wiki or through the discussion forum.`

    type: 'topic',
    content: `### Grading

There are 4 categories of graded problems in 18.01.1x: in-lecture Exercises, Part A Homework, Part B Homework, and the Final Exam. Part A Homework, Part B Homework, and the Final Exam have been removed from this Open Learning Library course.

* **Exercises** These are the problems that are interspersed between videos in each lecture. These problems count for 100% of your grade

    These problems will be used to motivate theory, practice a concept you just learned, and review material from previous sequences that we are using. While you are graded on these problems, they are low-stakes: you have multiple attempts, and have the opportunity to look at the answer after you have submitted a correct answer or run out of attempts. This is where you will do the majority of your learning. We encourage you to make mistakes and learn from them!

**Note:** Please notice that Unit 0 is optional and the exercises and homework are intended for self study only and do not count towards your grade.`
